## About

## Features

The original tutorial features:

- Cloud hosted images (Cloudinary)
- User search with regex
- Add/remove users from group chats
- Context API for managing state
- User authentication and authorization with JSON web tokens

My personal improvements over it:

- Custom hooks
- Better structure of the URLs for the API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The backend runs on `node 16.x`.

### Installing

In order to get a local development environment running, install all necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
