## About

## Features

The original tutorial features:

- socket.io for instant messaging
- Cloud hosted images (Cloudinary)
- User search with regex
- Add/remove users from group chats
- Context API for managing state
- User authentication and authorization with JSON web tokens

My personal improvements over it:

- Custom hooks
- Better structure of the URLs for the API
- Better socket management:
  - Leave a room when changing between chats
  - Close the socket on the log out
